A simple web application for a speech therapist’s office.

The first web application made by myself from the very beginning. The main idea of layout is based on client’s previous website, supported by WordPress. During development I tried to match application’s child-friendly layout with effects and usability dedicated to parents and grandparents mostly, as well as with basic accessibility. Although, the application is still in development – it is not mobile yet.  

Used technologies: HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript.
