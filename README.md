# Wymowka
A simple web application for a speech therapistâ€™s office.

The first web application made by myself from the very beginning. The main idea of layout is based on clientâ€™s previous website, supported by WordPress. During development I tried to match applicationâ€™s child-friendly layout with effects and usability dedicated to parents and grandparents mostly, as well as with basic accessibility. Designed as 'desktop first' but suitable also for tablets and smartphones.

Used technologies: HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript.
